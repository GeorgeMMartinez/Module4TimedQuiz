# Module4TimedQuiz

This application utilizes html, css, and javascript to generate a timed quiz containing questions about javascript.

Concept:
  When answering a question wrong, the time remaining should decrease by a certain amount. After completing the quiz, the user should be able to record their score using their initials. From the page, users can navigate to see the list of highscores from users. 

Future Development:
-Need to add code to decrease time when answering incorrectly.
-Clicking incorrect answers do not have a function.
-Need to create a highscores card/page.
